The Art of Analog CMOS IC Design Workshop is your gateway to mastering the fundamentals of analog circuit design, simulation, and layout. Whether you’re a student, researcher, or industry professional, this workshop provides hands-on experience with real-world applications. No prior experience in IC design is required—just a passion for electronics and a desire to explore the world of semiconductor technology. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have the skills to design, simulate, and layout analog circuits using open source, setting you on the path to becoming a skilled IC designer.

The workshop will cover the fundamentals of Analog IC Design, Simulation, and Layout, and is organized by alumni of the Department of Electronic & Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa together with Skill Surf.
