# 3.1 Analog IC Design Flow

Here the below diagram summarizes the analog design flow we are going to folow through this programme. This is the basic design flow for even more complex designs.

## Analog IC Design Flow Steps
---
### Schematic Entry
This involves the creation of the circuit schematic. Tools like **QUCS** or **Xschem** are typically used, which function similarly to **LTSpice**.  
These tools generate a **netlist**, which is the foundation for subsequent simulations and layout steps.
> **What is a netlist?**
> 
> A netlist is a hierarchical data structure that comprehensively details the interconnections and relationships between electronic components, including gates, transistors, flip-flops, and other logic elements, within an integrated circuit design. It essentially represents the connectivity among these components without specifying their physical layout.

### Analog & RF Simulation
This is the next step where the designed schematic is simulated to check for its functionality to gain an understanding whether it achieved the expected outcome.
**ngspice** and **Xyce** are simulation tools used to analyze the behavior of analog and RF circuits and further more these simulators allow for simulate some overtime variations of the IC also.

### Layout Drawing
Here the schematic is translated into a physical design that can be implemented on a silicon wafor, specifying where each component will be placed on the chip and how should they connected to each other. 
This is created using tools like **KLayout** or **Magic**. This kind of map navigates the CMOS components **geometry, size, and placement** of each to the silicon wafer.

### Design Rule Check (DRC)
This ensures that the layout meets the design rules required for successful fabrication.
Check and verifies properties like Spacing, Layer Widths and Alignment etc.  This is based on the fabrication process that we’re using. Each fabricator will supply their own rule set for the PDK.  

> Think of this like checking PCB trace spacing – if they’re too close, it can’t be fabricated reliably. 

### Layout vs. Schematic (LVS)
This check verifies that the **physical layout** is an accurate representation of the **original schematic**.  
It confirms that all devices and connections match without omissions or additions.

### Electromagnetic Simulation
Tools like **OpenEMS** are used to evaluate the **electromagnetic field behavior** of the layout.  
This is critical for **RF designs** to ensure signal integrity and to detect undesired coupling or radiation.

### Parasitic Extraction
Parasitic effects such as **unintended resistances, capacitances, and inductances** are extracted from the layout.  
These effects can degrade performance and must be accounted for in final simulations. This test identifies unwanted parasitic components in the layout. There are several reasons for generations of the parasitic effects and this helps to estimates how these parasitic will affect circuit performance.

### Post-Layout Simulation
This is the final simulation step, where the layout, including parasitic effects, is simulated. This ensures that the final design, including all parasitic elements, still meets the desired specifications.

### GDSII Generation
The design is exported to **GDSII format**, which is the industry standard for fabrication.  
This file includes the complete layout data (metal layers, vias, geometry) required by the **foundry** to manufacture the chip.
