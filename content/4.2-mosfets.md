# 4.2 IHP’s SG13G2 MOSFETs

### MOSFET Types and Symbols

The SG13G2 PDK provides parameterizable MOSFET symbols in Xschem:

- **Low-Voltage MOSFETs (1.5 V)**
  - `sg13_lv_nmos`: Vth ~ 0.5 V, Lmin = 0.13 µm
  - `sg13_lv_pmos`: Vth ~ -0.47 V, Lmin = 0.13 µm

- **High-Voltage MOSFETs (3.3 V)**
  - `sg13_hv_nmos`: Vth ~ 0.7 V, Lmin = 0.45 µm
  - `sg13_hv_pmos`: Vth ~ -0.65 V, Lmin = 0.45 µm

Symbols support the configuration of width (W), length (L), and multiplier (m). **Isolated variants of NMOS are also available**. 

## What is an Isolated NMOS?

In standard CMOS, all NMOS devices share a common P-substrate, meaning they share the body terminal.

An **isolated NMOS**:
- Is fabricated inside a **deep N-well** embedded in a **P-type epitaxial layer**.
- This allows the body terminal to be independently biased.
- Provides true 4-terminal operation (G, D, S, B).

### Benefits of Isolated NMOS
- Independent body control
- Reduced parasitic coupling
- Mitigates latch-up
- Improves analog and RF performance


### CMOS Transistor Terminals (4-pin mode)

| Terminal | Symbol | Function |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Gate     | G      | Controls the channel (via voltage) |
| Drain    | D      | Where current exits the transistor |
| Source   | S      | Where current enters the transistor |
| Body     | B      | Substrate; influences threshold voltage and leakage |

## The Role of the Body Terminal

- The body terminal in an **NMOS** is typically connected to the **lowest voltage** (GND).
- This prevents the **body effect**, which increases the threshold voltage \( V_{th} \) if the source and body are not at the same potential.
- The body terminal also helps prevent **leakage** and **latch-up** issues.
