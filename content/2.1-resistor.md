# 2.1 Resistor
A resistor is a two-terminal passive electronic component that resists the flow of electric current. Simply put, it limits how much current can pass through a circuit. It’s one of the fundamental building blocks in electronics.

The following circuit shows a resistor connected to a voltage source. The xschem simulation file can be found [here](./simulation_files/xschem/01_Resistor_DC_sweep.sch).

## Characteristics
Resistor behavior is governed by Ohm’s Law, which states:

$$V=IR$$

<br>
Where:

- $$V$$ is the voltage across the resistor,
- $$I$$ is the current through the resistor,
- $$R$$ is the resistance in ohms ($$Ω$$).

### Characteristics curve
The ideal resistor has a linear V-I characteristic, meaning voltage and current are directly proportional. When plotted on a graph:

## Resistance

Resistance ($$R$$) can be modeled by the mathematical equation,

$$
R = \frac{\rho A}{L}
$$

where:

- $$R$$ is the resistance in ohms (Ω),
- $$ \rho $$ is the resistivity of the material in ohm-meters (Ω·m),
- $$L$$ is the length of the conductor in meters (m),
- $$A$$ is the cross-sectional area of the conductor in square meters (m²).

In manufacturing process this equation is the fundamental model to make a resistor.


## IC level Implimentation
At the integrated circuit (IC) level, resistors are implemented directly on the silicon chip using materials such as poly-silicon or diffused regions within the silicon wafer. These resistive elements are carefully structured as thin, straight lines or serpentine (zig-zag) shapes to control the resistance value while fitting into a compact area. The fabrication of these resistors is done using standard CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) processes, which often overlap with the steps used for creating transistors.

## The sheet Resistance
Sheet resistance is defined by resistance per squre sheet in IC designing.

since,

$$
R=\frac{\rho l}{A}
$$

making the squre shape $$L=W$$ will result with, sheet resistance;

$$
R_s=\frac{\rho}{D}
$$

where $$D$$ is the depth of the resistor. so the sheet resistance will independent of the size of the squre. 

then any resistance can be implemented as,

$$
R=R_s.\frac{L}{W}
$$
