# 2. Basic Models

Integrated circuits (ICs) have a vast array of electronic components within a single semiconductor substrate. These components, ranging from basic passive elements like resistors, capacitors, and inductors to active devices such as diodes, BJTs, and MOSFETs, require precise modeling and implementation at the wafer level for effective performance.

Below is an exploration of these fundamental components, detailing their utilization, mathematical modeling, and IC-level design methodologies. This will help to get an initial understanding how the divices will work at the IC level.
