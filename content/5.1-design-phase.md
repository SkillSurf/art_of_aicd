# 5.1 Design Phase

## 5.1.1 Background 

First, open the schematic capture tool **Xschem**. Click [here](https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools?tab=readme-ov-file) to find download and installation details for the IIC OpenSource tools Docker container 

Go to a blank schematic by clicking the + mark

</figure>

## 5.1.2 Component selection and placement 

Need to include a PMOS transistor, an NMOS transistor, two Voltage sources, two code shown symbols and ground pins for this design. for that, go to the xschem folder in libs.tec folder in ihp-sg13g2 pdk as below 

<figure>
  <img src="./images/insert_location.png" alt=".tec file" width="50">
  <figcaption><em>Figure 5.1.2.1: Go to the above location as shown.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

Then, go inside the **sg13g2_pr** folder

  <figcaption><em>Figure 5.1.2.2: Go to the above location as shown to get primitive cells.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

Select the components you need. We expect to use low-voltage MOSFETS for this design.

-**list of the actual names of the components**  
  -sg13_lv_pmos.sym
  -sg13_lv_nmos.sym

After selecting each component, place them on the schematic canvas as shown below. You can use Shift+r to rotate the design

</figure>

Then, go inside the devices folder at xschem_library 

<figure>
  <img src="./images/devices.png" alt="devices" width="50">
  <figcaption><em>Figure 5.1.2.4: Path of devices folder at Xschem_Library </em></figcaption>
</figure>

Select the voltage source, the Code shown and the ground symbols 

-**List of the actual names of the components from devices**  
  -gnd.sym
  -vsource.sym
  -code_shown.sym
  -lab_pin.sym

You can use the "c" key to copy devices on the canvas

Final placement of the components should be as shown below

</figure>

## 5.1.3 Wiring of the Components 

You can use the "w" key to start the wiring between components, or you can use the insert wire tool as shown below. To connect points without a wire, you can use a lab_pin. This will give you a cleaner and professional design.

<figure>

  <figcaption><em>Figure 5.1.3.1: Insert_wire tool </em></figcaption>
</figure>

The wiring design should be like below

</figure>

## 5.1.4 Changing the parameters of the design 

To have the design we need, we need to change the W/L ratios of the MOSFETS as needed. To do that, double click on the MOSFET and change the values of the popped-up window 

<figure>
  <img src="./images/W:L ratios.png" alt="W/L ratios" width="50">
  <figcaption><em>Figure 5.1.4.1:Width over Length ratio</em></figcaption>
</figure>

We can decide the W/L ratio based on the drive current and supply voltage we need. 

-**List of characteristics we expect generally from an inverter**
  -Balanced Rise and Fall Times
  -Low Propagation Delay
  -Low power consumption 

These specifications might be changed according to your design. You can change W/L ratios after the simulation to get expected results. For example, to increase the speed, you need to increase the gain (gm) of the MOSFETS and to do this, you need to increase the W/L ratio, as the equation we explained earlier 

For this design, we use W/L ratio of the PMOS as 20 and W/L ratio of the NMOS as 10
