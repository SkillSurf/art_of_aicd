# 3.3 IIC-OSIC tools

In the rapidly evolving field of semiconductor design and fabrication, accessibility and affordability of design tools play a crucial role, particularly in educational and research institutions. The India IC Initiative (IIC) Open-Source IC Tools, also known as IIC-OSIC, are specifically designed to address this need. Initiated as part of a broader push towards developing a self-reliant semiconductor ecosystem in India, the IIC-OSIC suite provides comprehensive, open-source toolsets tailored for both analog and digital integrated circuit (IC) design.

## Purpose and Significance

The primary goal of IIC-OSIC tools is to democratize the semiconductor design process, allowing educational institutions, startups, and researchers easy and affordable access to advanced electronic design automation (EDA) resources. Traditional EDA tools are often prohibitively expensive, limiting access primarily to large organizations. By embracing open-source principles, IIC-OSIC encourages widespread innovation, skill development, and research, essential for nurturing India's semiconductor capabilities.


## Supported Technologies

IIC-OSIC Tools mainly support two significant open-source Process Design Kits (PDKs):
- Skywater 130nm (Sky130) PDK: A widely-adopted open-source PDK released through Google's collaboration with SkyWater Technology, providing detailed models and libraries for analog and digital circuit design at a 130nm technology node.
- SCL 180nm PDK: Developed in collaboration with India's Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL), this PDK supports a 180nm technology node. It facilitates designing circuits specifically targeting local fabrication facilities, further enhancing India's domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.


## Key Components and Features

The IIC-OSIC toolkit integrates various well-established open-source IC design tools, providing a complete end-to-end solution:
1. Xschem: A powerful schematic editor, allowing intuitive circuit representation and simulation preparation.
2. Ngspice: An open-source simulator derived from the renowned SPICE simulation engine, capable of analyzing both analog and mixed-signal circuits effectively.
3. Magic VLSI: A layout editor known for its simplicity and effectiveness, enabling designers to generate layout designs adhering to specified technology rules.
4. Netgen: Layout-versus-Schematic (LVS) checking tool, ensuring consistency between schematic diagrams and their physical layouts.
5. KLayout: A sophisticated viewer and editor for examining and manipulating layouts and verifying Design Rule Checks (DRC).

These integrated tools, coupled with comprehensive documentation and active community support, significantly lower the barrier to entry in IC design.

## Technical Implementation and Integration

The IIC-OSIC flow is built on containerized Docker images and Singularity recipes that package each EDA tool—Xschem, Ngspice, Magic VLSI, Netgen, and KLayout—with their respective PDKs (Sky130 and SCL180). Users clone the GitHub repository and run a single make command to fetch the PDK, compile the tool binaries with PDK-specific libraries, and launch a unified GUI session. Behind the scenes:

- PDK Integration: The Sky130 and SCL180 PDKs include technology files (.tf), symbol libraries (.sym), and device parameter sets (.lib) that Ngspice parses via .include directives. Custom .curl hooks pull updated transistor models daily.
- Automated LVS/DRC: Netgen scripts (lvs.run, drc.tcl) run in batch mode, invoking Technology Rule Files (.tch) and comparing GDSII layout exports against SPICE netlists, producing HTML reports and annotated GDS overlays.
- Schematic–Layout Sync: Xschem sessions generate SPICE decks using a .xschemrc export macro, which Magic VLSI’s gds <cell> command imports for layout generation. Floorplanning templates provided in Tcl scripts ensure consistent pin placement.
- Simulation Workflows: Ngspice leverages custom .plot directives and Python-based waveform parsers (using pyspice) to generate convergence-resilient transient, AC, noise, and Monte Carlo analyses. CI pipelines trigger these scripts on every commit.
- Batch Fabrication Submission: A command-line tool iic-submit wraps the final GDS and CSV mask data, signs it with the user’s SSH key, and uploads to SCL/fab4TB servers. Automated status polling notifies users via email when tape-out verification is complete.

Together, these tightly integrated processes allow users to move from schematic capture to fab-ready GDS in under an hour, with reproducible logs, version control, and community-maintained toolchains.
