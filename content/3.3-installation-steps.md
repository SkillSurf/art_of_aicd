# 3.3 IIC-OSIC tools

In the rapidly evolving field of semiconductor design and fabrication, accessibility and affordability of design tools play a crucial role, particularly in educational and research institutions. The India IC Initiative (IIC) Open-Source IC Tools, also known as IIC-OSIC, are specifically designed to address this need. Initiated as part of a broader push towards developing a self-reliant semiconductor ecosystem in India, the IIC-OSIC suite provides comprehensive, open-source toolsets tailored for both analog and digital integrated circuit (IC) design.
