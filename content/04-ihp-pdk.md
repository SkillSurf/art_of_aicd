# 4. IHP’s SG13G2 130nm CMOS Technology

The SG13G2 technology platform, developed by IHP Microelectronics, is a 130nm BiCMOS process that offers a set of devices and models tailored for analog, RF, and mixed-signal circuit design. This technology is particularly notable for its open-source accessibility through the IHP Open PDK and seamless integration with open-source EDA tools such as Xschem and Ngspice. SG13G2 supports both low-voltage (1.5 V) and high-voltage (3.3 V) MOSFETs, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from core digital logic to analog interfaces and RF circuits. In this section, we will have a proper guide throughout the IHP PDK.

For a quick glimpse IHP PDK includes features like multiple precision resistor types, high-quality capacitors (notably MIM capacitors), and up to 7 layers of aluminum metallization (5 thin and 2 thick). The PDK includes detailed device models based on the PSP 103.6 compact model, which offers symmetric behavior and comprehensive support for second-order effects, making it highly suited for analog and RF circuit simulations. The integration with the IIC-OSIC-TOOLS Docker image allows users to simulate circuits out of the box on most platforms, including Linux, Windows, macOS, and even Raspberry Pi. This section is divided into three topics. First, we look at the IHP’s SG13G2 130nm CMOS Technology, and then about the types of MOSFETs included there to use, and finally we will guide you through self learning process inlcude din the PDK.
