# 2.2 Capacitor

A capacitor is a two-terminal passive electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It resists changes in voltage by accumulating or releasing charge. Capacitors are essential in analog and digital circuits for filtering, coupling, decoupling, and timing applications.

The following circuit shows a capacitor connected to a voltage source. The xschem simulation file can be found [here](\simulation_files\xschem\02_Capacitor_Transient.sch).

## Characteristics

The relationship governing a capacitor is:

<span style="display:block; text-align:center; font-size: 1.2em;">\( I = C \frac{dV}{dt} \)</span>

Where:

- \( I \) is the current through the capacitor  
- \( C \) is the capacitance in farads (F)  
- \( \frac{dV}{dt} \) is the rate of change of voltage across the capacitor

### Charge and Discharge Behavior

When a voltage is applied across a capacitor, it charges exponentially. During discharge, the voltage decays exponentially. This time-dependent behavior is crucial in timing and filtering circuits.

## IC Level Implementation

At the integrated circuit (IC) level, capacitors are implemented using various structural techniques depending on the required capacitance, chip area, and fabrication technology. Common types include:

- **MOS Capacitors** – formed using the gate oxide of a MOS transistor structure. These are widely used for small-value capacitors in CMOS processes.
- **MIM (Metal-Insulator-Metal) Capacitors** – built between two metal layers separated by a dielectric. MIM capacitors provide higher accuracy and are preferred in analog and RF designs.
- **Poly-Poly Capacitors** – made between two layers of polysilicon with an insulating oxide in between.

The capacitance is given by the basic equation:

<span style="display:block; text-align:center; font-size: 1.2em;">\( C = \frac{\varepsilon A}{d} \)</span>

Where:

- \( \varepsilon \) is the permittivity of the dielectric  
- \( A \) is the area of overlap  
- \( d \) is the thickness of the dielectric  

These structures are laid out carefully in the chip layout to ensure predictable capacitance and reliability.
