"The Heart of Innovation: Choosing a Career in Analog IC Design" Keynote Speech by Dr. Nilan Udayanga. He is a Senior IC Design Engineer at Cirtec Medical Corporation, USA, specializing in integrated circuits for implantable medical applications. His journey in engineering began in 2007 at the University of Moratuwa, where he pursued undergraduate studies in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, graduating in 2011.

Motivated by a deep interest in microelectronics, Dr. Udayanga continued his academic path with a Master’s degree from the University of Akron (2013–2015). He further advanced his expertise by earning a Ph.D. from Florida International University in 2015, where he began his deep immersion into integrated circuit (IC) design. During his Doctoral studies, he completed his first tape-out and achieved his first publication in the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits (JSSC).

From 2019 to 2021, Dr. Udayanga served as a Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern California, contributing to innovative IC designs for implantable medical devices. His work on a dual-band transceiver (TRX) design during this time resulted in a patented technology. Since 2021, he has been working at Cirtec Medical, where he applies his extensive academic and research experience to develop ICs that support cutting-edge implantable medical technologies, driving real-world clinical impact.
