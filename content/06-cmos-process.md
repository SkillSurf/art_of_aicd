# 6. CMOS Process Technology

This section provides an introduction to the modern Semiconductor manufacturing technologies used to manufacture the Analog & Digital ICs designed using the design flows introduced in the previous sections. 

Manufacturing of an IC involves hundreds of steps and can take upto 3-6 months. Below video by IHP provides a quick look into the different stages a wafer goes through during the manufacturing process and gives an idea about the level of complexity of chip fabrication. Enjoy!

This section is divided into three sub sections. First sub section provides a quick glimpse into the differnet key technologies used in chip fabrication followed by a rough outline of the CMOS inverter fabrication flow in sub section two. The third section is dedicated to provide an overview of the modern packaging technologies used for IC packaging and final assembing.
