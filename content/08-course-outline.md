# 8. Course Outline

## Short description: 

The Analog IC Design, Simulation, and Chip Fabrication bootcamp provides an immersive, hands-on experience in integrated circuit design with a focus on theoretical and practical circuit analysis, as well as design techniques from system functional blocks and transitor-level device physics. Over three months, students will master the entire analog IC design flow, from concept to fabrication. First, they learn foundational concepts and define an operational amplifier IC project. Fundamental concepts include CMOS devices emphasizing functionality limitations caused by short channel effects, single-stage amplifiers, current mirrors, bandgap references and differential amplifiers. Second, they will focus on detailed schematics, layouts, and verification, culminating in submitting their designs for fabrication using an open-source PDK. Finally, the course concludes with a design project and competition, in which the specified operational amplifier is designed using two methods: the traditional square-law technique and the gm/Id graphical method. This comprehensive approach ensures students are well-prepared for careers in the semiconductor industry.
