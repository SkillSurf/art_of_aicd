# 3. Analog Design Flow with OSIC Tools

Analog IC design is a multi-stage process that transforms a conceptual circuit into a physically fabricated chip. The typical design flow includes many stages, from conceptual design to silicon-level implementation and testing. This is a multi-billion-dollar industry that promises a very interesting learning experience.
Making an analog IC in a silicon chip isn't just a complex process, It's an art of precision. This short video will give you an overall idea of the complexity of an analog IC. Just observe that this is from the perspective of an electron microscope.

From now on, we will guide you through these topics to get a more fundamental and overall idea about Analog Integrated Circuit Design flow. This section is divided into three sub-sections. The first subsection provides a quick glimpse into the CMOS analog flow, followed by a description of OSIC- tools used in this field in subsection two. The third section is dedicated to providing a detailed guide for setting up your environment for future work.
